# Generate UI functional test using cypress for a specific page.

Review the ui component at @workspace/<location of the component file .tsx or .jsx> and generate cypress based functional test. To mock the response from /<api-name> GET call use the fixture defined in @workspace/location of the fixture. The cyrpress.config.ts is already defined in @workspace/<location of the cypress.config.ts file>. This new functional test should be written to <name of the file> in the @workspace/<folder name> folder. If there are any environment variables to written to the cypress config file, please list them separately. If you need `data-testid` to reference any component in the `cy.get` selectors, please provide those recommendations, do not assume they exist.
