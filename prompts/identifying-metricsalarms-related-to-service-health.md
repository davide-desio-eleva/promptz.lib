# Identifying metrics/alarms related to service health

<task>
Your task is to analyze the code for two services, {{Service1}} and {{Service2}}, and identify any CloudWatch metrics or alarms related specifically to {{ALARM_TYPE}} that are present in {{Service2}} but missing in {{Service1}}.
</task>

<instructions>
To accomplish this task, follow these steps:
1. Review the code for {{Service2}}, which follows best practices for monitoring infrastructure using CloudWatch metrics and alarms. Take note of the metrics and alarms implemented specifically for {{ALARM_TYPE}}.
2. Carefully examine the code for {{Service1}}.
3. Compare the two code bases and identify any CloudWatch metrics and alarms specifically related to {{ALARM_TYPE}} that are implemented in {{Service2}} but not present in {{Service1}}.
4. Keep in mind that metric and alarm names may be slightly different between the two code packages, but focus on the underlying functionality and severity.
</instructions>

Provide your response in the following format:
<rationale>
Provide a list of all metrics and alarms present in {{Service2}} related to {{ALARM_TYPE}}. Treat same alarms of different severity as different. Also mention why each metric and alarm is important. Provide a code reference of where each metric and alarm is present in {{Service2}} and where it can be added in {{Service1}}.
</rationale>
<missing_alarms>
- [First alarm or metric name], [Severity of the alarm in the form SEV_1/SEV_2/SEV_3. Use NA if not specified.], [Brief explanation about why this metric is important]
- [Second alarm or metric name], [Severity of the alarm in the form SEV_1/SEV_2/SEV_3. Use NA if not specified.], [Brief explanation about why this metric is important]

Please provide your response immediately after these instructions, enclosed in the <rationale></rationale> and

The code for {{Service2}} is presented below within <{{Service2}}></{{Service2}}> tags.
The code for {{Service1}} is presented below within <{{Service1}}></{{Service1}}> tags.
