# CDK Typescript Best Practices

# CDK TypeScript Rules

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names and interface names.
- Use camelCase for interface members.
- Use PascalCase for type names and enum names.

## Type System

- Avoid using the `any` type as it defeats TypeScript's type checking
- Use specific types or create custom types when needed
- Use union types when a variable can only be one of a limited set of values
- Use destructuring on properties to extract multiple pieces of data from an array or object and assign them to new variables.
- Use the let keyword to declare a local variable instead of using the var keyword
- Always define return types for functions to make the API contract clear
- Use `Partial<Type>` when all properties of a type should be optional
- Use `Required<Type>` to make all properties of a type required
- Use `Pick` to create a type with only the properties you need

## Interfaces

- Use interfaces to standardize construct or stack properties ensuring that callers provide the expected parameters.
- Avoid empty interfaces
- Mark interface properties that should not be modified after initialization as `readonly`

## Enums

- Use enums to define sets of related constants
- Export enums at the global level for reuse
- Prefer string enums over numeric enums for better debugging and readability

## Linting and Formatting

- Use ESLint to identify issues. Fix them immediately
- Use Prettier as code-formatter
